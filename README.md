### What is this repository for? ###

A program that encrypts texts files using a Vigenere cipher.
Version 1.0


### How do I get set up? ###

Once the code is compiled (or by using the .exe in /bin) simply place the file to be encrypted in the same directory
as the .exe and then run the .exe on the command line with the name of the file and the encryption key as arguements.
The encrypted text will appear as a next .txt labled "Output."
